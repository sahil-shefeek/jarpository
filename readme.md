## Navigation

Navigating through the repository is made easy through thoughtful organization.

The directory structure of Jarpository follows a clear hierarchy. Here is an outline of this structure, arranged from the most to the least significant level:

| Priority Level |                             Concept                             |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       1        |                              Files                              |
|       2        |                       Exception Handling                        |
|       3        | OOP+<br>(Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) |
|       4        |          OOP basics:<br> Classes, Objects and methods           |
|       5        |                             Strings                             |

|       8        |                Loops and Conditional Statements                 |
|       9        |           Flow Control (`switch`, `if`, `else`, etc.)           |
|       10       |                     Miscellaneous Concepts                      |

Each priority level corresponds to a dedicated directory or folder. Certain levels may have subdirectories to represent closely related concepts.

#### Example Usage

Suppose you're searching for a Java program that covers:

a) Inheritance,
b) Polymorphism, and
c) Exception Handling.

In this case, you can efficiently navigate the repository's structure as follows:

1. **Inheritance**: Begin by exploring the **_inheritance_** directory as it has higher priority.

2. **Polymorphism**: After reviewing inheritance, proceed to the **_polymorphism_** directory.

3. **Exception Handling**: Finally, navigate to the **_exception_handling_** directory that contains programs related to exception handling.

Following this path will lead you to: **Inheritance > Polymorphism > ExceptionProgram.java**

## Setup

To make use of the programs within this repository, you should have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-shefeek/jarpository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```shell
   cd jarpository
   ```

3. Compile and run any program using the Java compiler. For instance, to compile and run the program named `Program.java`, use these commands:

   ```shell
   javac Program.java
   java Program
   ```

Each program is stored in a separate file with a descriptive name. To use a specific program:

1. Open the program file (e.g., `Program.java`) with a text editor.

2. Study the comments and code to grasp the program's purpose and functionality.

3. Modify the code if necessary or use it as a reference for your projects.

4. Save your changes and follow the setup instructions above to compile and run the program.
